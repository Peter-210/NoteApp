## Features
- Follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to separate the view (UI) from the model (data) by utilizing three software layers. These layers are the view, model, and viewmodel which links the two layers together using data binding.

- Locally saves and store note data using JSON files that are updated after every change to the note's content.

- Add, edit and delete notes which will update the collection view using an observable collection.
